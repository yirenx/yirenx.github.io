(Bruno Munari)\n\nHi there! I am a PhD Candidate in Statistics, working with  Erik Sudderth  (UCI) and  Michele Guindani  (UCLA). I combine Bayesian statistics and machine learning approaches to develop statistical models for structured data and scalable computational methods. I am a fellow of the  HPI Research Center in Machine Learning and Data Science at UCI .\nI am very passionate about statistics and data science education. I work on a variety of teaching and research projects in this area, including on formative feedback to data science assignments, gamification, scientific writing and Bayesian thinking in STEM.\nOutside of academia, I enjoy spending time in nature, playing board games and organizing road trips.\nMy pronouns are she/her and this is how my name is pronounced:"
