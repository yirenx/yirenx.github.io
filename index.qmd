::: {#yiren-heading}

Hello! I am a PhD candidate in Statistics at the University of California, Irvine, advised by Dr.<a href="https://dgillen.ics.uci.edu" target="_blank"> Dan Gillen </a>. I work on topics in survival analysis and clinical trial design. Currently, I am developing methods in performing sampling, estimation, and power analysis in the case-cohort design for modeling recurrent events. 

I also work with Dr.<a href="https://sites.mind.uci.edu/grill/" target="_blank"> Josh Grill </a> and other researchers in the Grillen Lab on projects in recruitment science and Alzheimer's disease.

When I'm not working on research, I love to cook, watch movies, and discover new restaurants.
